# A todo list app for productivity tracking

Just a project I am working on as I think of a bigger productivity project.

# TODO so far...

1. Add CSS to it to make it appealing
2. Use the time to learn about git branching
3. Add feature where if someone inputs nothing the app alerts you that you have added nothing
